magicFormulae
=============

Software for creation of Magical Formulae in a similar fashion as Franz Bardon. The process is further complicated by allowing the user to choose hebrew characters or Bardon originals. Users will also be able to select the leters based on different criteria including a selection based on the different trees of life diagrams (GD, Ari, Gra and so on ...).

This is a webapp so I can reference it from different platforms.
